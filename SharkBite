        -- wait until game starts to use this script
        -- this script WILL Kick you from the game but it gives 1M+ Teeth
        -- make sure  to stand up
        -- if it stops giving you money you can leave
        -- teeth generator works too but this is faster.
        -- if your game doesnt crash it will give you a max of 1500000
